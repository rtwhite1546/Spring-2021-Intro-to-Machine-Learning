    "\n",
    "## Lecture 14: K-fold Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `scikit-learn` implementation details, see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html. We will frequently use the method in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lecture 15: Probability Crash Course for Classification and the Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we followed parts of Ch 2 and Ch 18.1 from [Data Mining and Machine Learning: Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms](https://dataminingbook.info/) by Zaki and Meira, Jr.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification problems** are problems where we would like to take datapoints and assign them to an appropriate **class** based on some examples that have known classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we have a dataset of medical records where each datapoint has a single patient's age, weight, blood pressure, status as a smoker or not, and other information and each patient is known to either have or not have kidney disease. We might want take data from a new patient and predict if he or she is likely to develop kidney disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we have a dataset of labeled images of cat and dogs, we might want to take a new image and classify whether it has a dog or a cat. (How does Google image search know how to find pictures of what you search?)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we have a dataset of audio files, each of which is a jazz, classical, rock, pop, or hip-hop song, we might want to predict the genre of a new audio file. (Spotify does this kind of analysis to recommend songs based on your listening history.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we have a dataset of traffic logs on a network, some known to be infected by a specific virus and some are not, we might want to use this information to classify a new traffic log as likely to be infected or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we have a dataset of sounds of people speaking along with transcripts of the words, we might want to classify the words spoken into a microphone. (Think Siri!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases, the information can be represented as a point in the $n$-dimensional real space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The medical records would have numbers for age, weight, and blood pressure and a binary digit for non-smoker or smoker.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/medicalRecords.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dog/cat images might have three channels for a picture, meaning three numbers for each pixel (the red, green, and blue levels) like the bird picture below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/birdRGB.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "* The audio files might have numbers specifying the type of sound for the song many times per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/audioFile.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "* The network traffic logs might have numbers of packets transferred, file size, ports, addresses, the content of the packets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The audio files might have numbers specifying the type of sound for a word many times per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/audioWords.png\" />\n",
    "The blue lines indicate the beginning of a word and the red lines indicate the ends of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all mature applications, there are likely preprocessing steps done before the classification is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose these applications to demonstrate two things: (1) classification problems are interesting and useful in almost every area of study and (2) a huge class of classification problems have much in common mathematically. All apply to datapoints, although some types of data may have far more dimensions than others--a medical record may only have 10 to 12 numbers, but a 12-megapixel photo from the latest iPhone would have $4,000\\times 3,000\\times 3=36,000,000$ numbers, 3 for each pixel).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Math of a Classification Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To exploit the similarities, let's abstract away the specifics of the applications for now and think about how to describe a classification problem mathematically. Consider a $d$-dimensional point, or vector, $x_1\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ and denote $x=(x_{11},x_{12},...,x_{1d})$. $x$ is a member one of $k$ classes $C=\\{c_1, c_2, ..., c_k\\}$. We call the point $x_1$ an **example** and we call the class the **label** of $x_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a classification problem is to find a function $M:\\mathbb{R}^d\\to C$ mapping each example $x_1$ to its class $y_1=M(x_1)$ and will generalize to successfully classify new, unlabeled datapoints with high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will segment the space $\\mathbb{R}^d$ into sets $X_j=\\{x_1\\in\\mathbb{R}^d | M(x_1)=c_j\\}$ corresponding to each class. In the image below, for example, the space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is partitioned into three sets colored red, blue, and green.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/knnTessellation.png\" />\n",
    "The colored points are labeled examples and the $\\mathbb{R}^2$ space is colored by the class to be assigned to points in different regions. (image from Wikipedia)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithms used for classification. Some of the most popular include\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bayes and naive Bayes\n",
    "* $k$-nearest neighbors\n",
    "* decision trees\n",
    "* logistic regression\n",
    "* support vector machines\n",
    "* neural networks (many types)\n",
    "\n",
    "as well as tree-based algorithms that systematically apply an ensemble of different classifiers. Any of the methods above are good choices and there are pros and cons of each, but we only consider the Bayes classifiers this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Success\n",
    "\n",
    " For a specific class labeled 1, we denote\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{00}$ is the number of test examples in class 0 classified in class 0 (true negatives)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
